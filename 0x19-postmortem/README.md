     **Postmortem: Integration of Datadog and Ubuntu for Web Server**
**Issue Summary:**

 **May 10, 2023 (10:00AM) to May 11, 2023 (2:00AM) WAT**
 
 Impact: The integration of Datadog monitoring with the Ubuntu web server encountered challenges, resulting in inconsistent data collection and limited visibility into server metrics.
This affected the ability to effectively monitor and troubleshoot the server's (Web Server 1) performance.

**Timeline (all times WAT - West African Time)**

May 10, 2023 - 10:00AM: Integration efforts began to implement Datadog monitoring on the Ubuntu web server.

May 10, 2023 - 1:00PM: Issue detection - during routine monitoring, it was noticed that server metrics were not being consistently reported to Datadog.

May 10, 2023 - 4:10PM: Actions taken - I investigated the configuration files and agent setup to identify potential misconfigurations or compatibility issues.

May 10, 2023 - 8:35PM: Misleading investigation/debugging paths - Initially, the investigation focused on network connectivity and firewall configurations, assuming that these might be blocking communication between the server and Datadog.

May 10, 2023 - 10:17PM: The incident was escalated to the team made up of my cohorts for further analysis and resolution.

May 11, 2023 - 12:30AM: After an in-depth investigation, it was discovered that the version of the Datadog agent region (US5) installed on the Ubuntu server was incompatible with the server's underlying operating system.

May 11, 2023 - 2:00AM:Resolution: The incompatible Datadog agent version was uninstalled, and a compatible version was installed, ensuring proper communication and data collection.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**
The root cause of the issue was the installation of an incompatible version of the Datadog agent region (US5) on the Ubuntu web server. This resulted in a failure to collect and transmit server metrics to the Datadog monitoring platform.
To resolve the issue, I uninstalled the incompatible Datadog agent version and replaced it with a compatible version that was verified to work with the Ubuntu server. This allowed for successful communication between the server and Datadog, restoring the data collection and monitoring capabilities.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**

1. Compatibility Testing: Prior to installation, conduct compatibility testing between the monitoring agent and the server's operating system to ensure compatibility and avoid similar issues.

2. Documentation Review: Review and update documentation related to the integration process, including specific versions and requirements for the monitoring agent and the supported operating systems.

3. Version Management: Implement version management practices to track and control the installation of monitoring agents and their compatibility with the underlying infrastructure.

4. Monitoring Health Checks: Establish regular health checks to verify the continuous functionality of monitoring agents and data transmission to detect any potential issues early on.

5. Training and Knowledge Sharing: Provide training to other team members regarding proper integration procedures. 

**Tasks to Address the Issue:**

1. Uninstall Incompatible Agent Versions: Identify and uninstall any incompatible Datadog agent versions across the infrastructure.

2. Upgrade Datadog Agents: Install the latest compatible versions of the Datadog agent on all Ubuntu web servers.

3. Document Compatibility Requirements: Document the specific compatibility requirements between monitoring agents and operating systems to guide future installations and upgrades.

4. Develop Integration Checklist: Create a comprehensive checklist outlining the necessary steps and considerations for integrating Datadog monitoring with Ubuntu web servers.

**Conclusion:**

The integration of Datadog monitoring with the Ubuntu web server encountered challenges due to the installation of an incompatible agent version. Through thorough investigation and resolution, the root cause was identified and addressed by installing a compatible version. Implementing corrective measures, including compatibility testing and documentation updates, will mitigate the risk of similar issues in the future, ensuring reliable and effective monitoring of the web server infrastructure.
